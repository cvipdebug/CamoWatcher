### **CamoWatcher - Real-Time Camo Unlock Detection**

**CamoWatcher** is a Python-based tool designed to monitor a selected screen region for Call of Duty camo unlock notifications. Leveraging OCR technology, it detects and extracts the camo name from real-time game footage, ensuring you never miss a milestone.

### **Features**
- üéØ **Accurate Text Recognition**: Uses [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to detect camo unlock messages from the game screen.  
- üì° **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously scans the selected region for new notifications.  
- üîÑ **Duplicate Detection Prevention**: Ensures the same camo is not reported multiple times in quick succession.  
- üñºÔ∏è **Custom Region Selection**: Interactively select the area of the screen you want to monitor.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Live Preview (Optional)**: Displays the monitored region in a preview window.  
- ‚ö° **Lightweight & Efficient**: Designed to run seamlessly in the background without affecting game performance.

### **How It Works**
1. Select the screen region to monitor via a simple click-and-drag interface.  
2. CamoWatcher scans the selected area in real-time, processing text with OCR.  
3. When a camo unlock message is detected, it prints the camo name in this format:  
   ```
   [CamoWatcher] Camo Unlocked: {CAMO_NAME}
   ```
4. The tool prevents duplicate notifications by tracking the last detected camo name.
